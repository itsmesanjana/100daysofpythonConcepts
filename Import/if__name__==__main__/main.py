# import harry as hr
# hr.welcome()
#If u run this file it prints the welcome function content from the harry.py so that's why we get the output as two times....
 #because we are calling the welcome function twice one in this file and one in harry.py file

#If u run this file then it gives imported module name after using if __name__=="__main__" syntax
